# discEval

Evaluating maps based on their properties using discrete math terms.

Directions: 

In the following sections we will assess the properties of an inputted function. The function will be inputted in 3 parts:

A list of the values in the domain 
domain = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4]

A list of the values in the co-domain
co_domain = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7]

A dictionary of the function mapping between the domain and the co-domain:

mapping = {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 3}


The example domain, co-domain, and mapping given above would represent this function:

Write a function to check whether an inputted function is onto. The python function should be called
is onto, should take in the 3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain, and mapping),
and should return a boolean, True or False.

(b) Write a function to check whether an inputted function is one-to-one. The python function should be
called is one to one, should take in the 3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain,
and mapping), and should return a boolean, True or False.

(c) Write a function to check whether an inputted function is bijective. (Hint: you can utilize your other
functions in writing this one!) The python function should be called is bijective, should take in the
3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain, and mapping) and should return a boolean,
True or False.
